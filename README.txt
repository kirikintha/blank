##Summary

This is a blank module "template" with all the major module hooks, directories etc ready for you to start working.
Change all this information here, and remember to document like crazy!

You should erase this stuff and add in your own, if not BAD DEVELOPER!

##How It works

The best thing to do is use your IDE to replace all the "blank" names with your module names. Just remember they are in the install, info and module files. There should not be anything in the css, inc and theme directories, because you may not need them.

I prefer to make classes for my module specific functions, so they are outside of drupal's namespacing entirely and can be destroyed more easily for memory management.

##Contacting the Maintainer of This project

Please feel free to contact me via github or drupal.org. My handle is "kirikintha" it's easy to find me. Support requests should allow between 3-5 business days, and I have to reserve the right to push off new features to the next version. My plan is to have quarterly releases, unless there is an emergency bug that crashes everything, which I will do my best to resolve as quickly as I can.

Thank you very much for using my module, I hope it works for you bug free!
